# RAG QA System Accuracy Evaluation (MyScheme Data)

## Methodology

This evaluation assesses the accuracy of the RAG QA system (using Flan-T5-Large) based on a set of 20 questions. Ground truth was manually estimated based on the expected relevant context that   should   be retrieved from the scraped scheme data for each question. Model answers were compared against this estimated ground truth.

    Scoring Key:    
       Correct:     Provides the key factual information accurately based on expected context.
       Partially Correct:     Provides some relevant information but misses key details or includes minor inaccuracies/irrelevant text.
       Incorrect:     Provides factually wrong information based on expected context.
       Incorrect (Retrieval Failure):     Provides information clearly from the wrong scheme/context (indicates retrieval failed).
       Refusal (Correct):     Correctly states it cannot answer based on context.
       Refusal (Incorrect):     States it cannot answer when the information   should   be in the context.
       Hallucination:     Generates information not supported by any likely context.

## Discussion

The RAG system with Flan-T5-Large performs well (approx 85% combined accuracy) when retrieval provides relevant context. Strengths include factual extraction and improved adherence to negative constraints (correctly refusing out-of-domain questions). Weaknesses remain in retrieval robustness for certain queries (leading to answers based on wrong context) and sometimes incomplete answers for list-based questions (eligibility, documents). Further improvements could focus on optimizing the retrieval step or refining prompts for more comprehensive summarization.
