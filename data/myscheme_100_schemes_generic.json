Registered Karkhanas/Karkhandars are identified who are willing to enroll a batch of trainees and ex-trainees in their Karkhana. A minimum of five trainees for a small Karkhana and a maximum of 10 trainees for a big Karkhana. A minimum of one and a maximum of five training programs per craft shall be considered for the six-month duration of the training program.\n﻿\nObjectives of the Scheme:\n1.  Revive the languishing crafts.\n2.  Upscale the learning techniques of trainees.\n3.  Improve the wage earnings of the craftsmen by leading them into collectivization\n4.  Create linkages with producer organizations to inculcate entrepreneurship skills and aptitude in the trainees.\n﻿\nVision of the scheme:\nThe artisans who form the backbone of the craft sector work in an exploitative chain of business leading them to a vicious cycle of poverty and pessimism. A huge number of artisans (mostly the male folk) are forced to abandon the craft activity due to low wage earnings and poor socio-economic status. It is felt that this scheme shall emerge as one of the most effective pathways to address the challenges being faced by the artisan community. Exposing the pass-out trainees to improved productivity procedures adopted by producer groups can lead them to better productivity and leverage their collective skill up-gradation which can help in promoting sustainable livelihoods as the artisans can gain direct access to customized production, new design development, technology-related modifications, and above all can have the pulse of market demands."

Farmers are paid an incentive of Rs 35 for every surviving seedling at the end of the first year, Rs 40 after the completion of the second year, and Rs 50 after the completion of the third year. This is done to encourage the farmers to nurture the seedlings for at least three years.\n﻿\nThe amount of money provided as an incentive (Rs 125/- per seedling) more than compensates the cost incurred by the farmer in procuring and planting the seedling. The incentive is quite substantial when the farmer plants more seedlings. In addition to the financial incentive, the farmers are entitled to get handsome returns from the grown-up trees in the form of fruits, seeds, fodder, firewood, pole, timber, and other useful products."

The Chief Minister's Micro-finance Initiative will help hardworking farmers and young entrepreneurs get credit. Individuals, Self Help Groups, and Farmer Producer Organizations will benefit from the initiative, which aims to make credit more inexpensive and accessible. To that end, he stated that the government will grant either a subsidy or an interest subsidy to specified activities in agriculture and associated sectors, such as processing units, handicrafts, and small-scale manufacturing.\nAdditional interest subvention would be offered in addition to what is already available under existing Central Government schemes. The programme will assist farmers in increasing their revenues, promoting credit discipline, encouraging private entrepreneurship, and improving our state's agri-marketing network and infrastructure.\nBeneficiaries will be chosen by District Level Selection Committees, with Village Councils acting as guarantors when necessary. The scheme's precise framework will be announced separately.\nThe eligible beneficiaries for the scheme are farmers, entrepreneurs, Self Help Groups, Farmer Producer Organisations/companies and cooperative societies. The eligible schemes are the construction of circular eco-hatchery, rejuvenation of animal husbandry through credit linkage, procurement of transport vehicles for agriculture products, integrated farming system, horticulture crop loan scheme and microfinance scheme for micro-enterprises.\nIndividual Farmers\nwho are keen to invest in agri-allied and other activities for a better livelihood would be assisted as per the norms of the Scheme.\nSelf-Help Groups:\nSHGs have been a key element of credit extension to the poor and small entrepreneurs. They undertake activities in a group mode which benefits the community as well as provides meaningful livelihood opportunities to the members. SHGs have been supported under various programs being implemented in the State. The Government of Nagaland endeavours to further support the SHGs through this scheme to expand the scope of economic activities that can supplement the needs, especially of the rural household.\nFarmer Producer Organizations\n(Registered under Societies Act, Co-operative Societies Act or Company Act): Farmer Producer Organizations are Farmers’ Collectives, and with characteristics of legal personality and limited liability similar to a company, can attract investments, modern technology, catalyse aggregating and marketing of bulk produce to fetch better remuneration and in turn lead to improved means of production. Although very few in number at present, in the state, they present huge opportunities and have been considered eligible entities under the scheme.\n﻿\n﻿"

PMAY-G aims at providing a pucca house, with basic amenities, to all houseless households and those households living in kutcha and dilapidated house. PMAY-G addresses the rural housing shortage and bridges the housing deficit in rural areas of India, contributing significantly to the mission of \"Housing for All\". The minimum size of the houses under PMAY-G is 25 sq m including a dedicated area for hygienic cooking. As of 27th Sept 2022, 2.00 crore houses have been constructed out of the total target of 2.72 crores. The beneficiaries are identified using the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) parameters and verified by the Gram Sabhas. The amount is transferred directly to the Aadhaar-Linked Bank Account / Post-Office Account of the beneficiary. PMAY-G has been extended for another two years, i.e. till 31st March 2024.\nAim and Objective:\nPMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all houseless households and households living in kutcha and dilapidated house in rural areas by 2024. The immediate objective is to cover 1.00 Crore households in rural areas, that are houseless or living in kutcha / dilapidated house, in three years from 2016-17 to 2018-19 and enable construction of quality houses by the beneficiaries using local materials, designs and trained masons. For houses to become homes, adoption of a habitat approach through convergence is proposed."

There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others.\nii.  To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order.\niii.  In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.\nWithin the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of \"compulsory inclusion\", will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores.\nThe scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:\ni.\tHouseholds with no adult member between ages 16 to 59\nii.\tFemale-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59\niii.\tHouseholds with no literate adult above 25 years\niv.\tHouseholds with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member\nv.\tLandless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual labor\nvi. Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.\nNote:\nTo ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas.\nEarmarking of Targets -\nFor SC/ST:\n60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the 'Other' categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.\nFor Minorities:\nFurther, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.\nFor PwDs:\nAccordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.\nTie Breaker\nIn case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:\ni.\tHouseholds with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.\nii.\tHouseholds where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).\niii.\tHouseholds with a single girl child.\niv.\tBeneficiary families of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act.\nv.\tTransgender persons."
